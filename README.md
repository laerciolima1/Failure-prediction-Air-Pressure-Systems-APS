## APS Failure Prediction: Exploratory Data Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction

### Introduction
This project aims to analyze data obtained from sensors of the Scania trucks to predict failures due to air pressure systems (APS). This dataset contains only two classes, positive and negative. The ultimate goal of this project is to prepare the dataset for future modeling by reducing its dimensionality.

In addition, this project will cover important concepts such as exploratory data analysis, data preparation, handling imbalanced data, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning.

### Data
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 60000 instances and 171 attributes, out of which 27 are categorical attributes.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a critical step in any data analysis project. In this project, I will use various EDA techniques to better understand the APS failure dataset and identify any patterns or relationships in the data. I will explore the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and explore relationships between variables.

### Data Preparation
Data preparation is an essential step in any data analysis project. In this project, I will address problems such as missing values and scaling, and encode categorical variables. These techniques will allow me to better understand the dataset and prepare it for modeling.

### Handling Imbalanced Data
Imbalanced data is a common problem in machine learning, where one class has significantly more data than the other. In this project, I will address this problem by using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which is a method for oversampling the minority class. This technique will help me balance the data and improve the performance of the model.

### Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction is a critical step in machine learning, where the number of features or dimensions is reduced to prevent overfitting and improve the performance of the model. In this project, I will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the APS failure dataset. By reducing the number of features, I can improve the performance of the model and prevent overfitting.

### Machine Learning
In this project, I will use Random Forest Classifier to predict the APS failure. Random Forest is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can handle high-dimensional datasets and is resistant to overfitting. I will train the model on the prepared data and evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Conclusion
This project covered various concepts such as exploratory data analysis, data preparation, handling imbalanced data, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning. The experience obtained after dealing with missing values, scaling, and modeling gave me a better understanding of real dataset problems.
